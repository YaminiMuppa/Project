      <P>Ceramic material is an inorganic, metallic oxide,
      nitride, or carbide material. Some elements, such as carbon or silicon, may be considered ceramics.
      Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in shearing and tension. 
      They withstand the chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. 
      Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, ranging from 1,000 °C to 1,600 °C (1,800 °F to 3,000 °F).
      Human beings appear to have been making their own ceramics for at least 26,000 years, subjecting clay and silica to intense heat 
      to fuse and form ceramic materials. The earliest found so far were in southern central Europe and were sculpted figures, 
      not dishes.The earliest known pottery was made by mixing animal products with clay and firing it at up to 800 °C (1,500 °F). 
      While pottery fragments have been found up to 19,000 years old, it was not until about 10,000 years later that regular pottery 
      became common. An early people that spread across much of Europe is named after its use of pottery: the Corded Ware culture. 
      These early Indo-European peoples decorated their pottery by wrapping it with rope while it was still wet. When the ceramics 
      were fired, the rope burned off but left a decorative pattern of complex grooves on the surface.</P>
